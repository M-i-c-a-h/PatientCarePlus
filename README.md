# PatientCare+
Originally envisioned as an Android-based solution using a sensor-equipped chip to measure patient vitals such as heart rate, blood sugar and blood pressure, this project sought to streamline remote health monitoring. Patients would rely on the device and a companion app to receive real-time health analytics, get personalized recommendations and share data directly with their healthcare providers, reducing unnecessary hospital visits and improving ongoing care.

This project is a prototype web application, developed with .NET Core, React, MUI, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, serves as a proof of concept inspired by that initial idea. Although it doesn’t integrate with physical sensors or run on Android, it replicates the original concept’s core workflow: tracking patient metrics, assessing health risks and offering tailored health advice. By moving these features into a browser-based environment, the project demonstrates the feasibility and versatility of the approach, setting the stage for future iterations that could reintroduce mobile platforms and hardware integration.
