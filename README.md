## Description

Originally envisioned as an Android-based solution using a sensor-equipped chip to measure patient vitals such as heart rate, blood sugar and blood pressure, this project sought to streamline remote health monitoring. Patients would rely on the device and a companion app to receive real-time health analytics, get personalized recommendations and share data directly with their healthcare providers, reducing unnecessary hospital visits and improving ongoing care.

This project is a prototype web application, developed with .NET Core, React, MUI, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, serves as a proof of concept inspired by that initial idea. Although it doesn’t integrate with physical sensors or run on Android, it replicates the original concept’s core workflow: tracking patient metrics, assessing health risks and offering tailored health advice. By moving these features into a browser-based environment, the project demonstrates the feasibility and versatility of the approach, setting the stage for future iterations that could reintroduce mobile platforms and hardware integration.

## Personal Contribution
***Project Management*** <br>
I played a role in designing and engineering the system architecture of PatientCare+, ensuring the system's performance met the expected benchmarks. Using tools like **Figma** and **Lucidchart**, I mapped out workflows, designed data models, and documented system requirements to align with project goals.

***Backend Development*** <br>
I developed a robust, stateless API using **HTTP** and ensured seamless database operations by maintaining data integrity. The backend implementation was fully executed in **C#** with the **.NET Core Framework**. My contributions included implementing user authorization and authentication, developing API endpoints for seamless system communication, designing and deploying services to handle server-side operations, and managing database CRUD functionalities. Tools used included **Visual Studio**, **Postman**, **swagger**, and **SQL Server Management Studio**.

***Frontend Development*** <br>
On the frontend, I focused on designing and implementing doctor-related features of PatientCare+, creating user-friendly interfaces that enabled doctors to manage patient health data effectively. This involved building responsive, intuitive layouts and integrating backend services to provide real-time updates.
